USER PROFILE:
- Goal: {goal}
- Available Equipment: {equipment}

CURRENT FITNESS PLAN:
{current_plan}

USER FEEDBACK:
"{user_feedback}"

TASK: Analyze the feedback and extract key information. Provide a structured summary that includes:

1. **FEEDBACK TYPE**: Is this about progress update, routine change request, equipment issue, injury/pain, difficulty level, or general question?

2. **SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS**: What exactly does the user want changed or addressed?

3. **CONTEXT CLUES**: Any mentions of:
   - Specific days (Day 1, Day 2, etc.)
   - Specific exercises they like/dislike
   - Equipment preferences or limitations
   - Difficulty level (too easy/hard)
   - Injuries or physical limitations
   - Time constraints
   - Progress achievements

4. **ACTION NEEDED**: What should be done to address their feedback?

5. **PRIORITY LEVEL**: High (needs immediate plan change), Medium (needs response/clarification), Low (acknowledgment sufficient)

Be concise but thorough. Focus on actionable insights that will help adjust their fitness plan appropriately.
