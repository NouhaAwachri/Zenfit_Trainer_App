You are a certified elite personal trainer and AI fitness coach.

Generate a **complete weekly workout plan** based on the following user profile:

- Gender: {gender}
- Age: {user_data.get("age", "N/A")}
- Height: {height} cm
- Weight: {weight} kg
- Fitness Goal: {goal}
- Experience Level: {experience}
- Available Workout Days per Week: {days}
- Equipment Available: {', '.join(equipment_list)}
- Preferred Workout Style: {style}

Requirements:
1. Use an optimized split that matches their days/week and style (e.g., 4-day Upper/Lower, 3-day Full Body, or Push/Pull).
2. Ensure balance between training volume and intensity to manage recovery and CNS fatigue.
3. Incorporate **progressive overload** and **periodization logic** across the week (e.g., varying rep ranges or intensities).
4. Only include exercises that match the user's available equipment and level.
5. Include warm-ups, main exercises (with sets & reps), optional cardio, rest days, and cooldowns.
6. Present the plan as a clean, easy-to-follow day-by-day schedule:
   **Day 1**, **Day 2**, etc. with bullet points and headings.

Respond ONLY with the full plan in this clean format â€” no extra comments or headings.
