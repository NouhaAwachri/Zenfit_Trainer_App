Upper Legs,dumbbell-romanian-deadlift,"Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift Upper Legs / Dumbbell Performing a Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL) effectively targets your hamstrings, glutes, and lower back muscles while also engaging your core for stability. Here's how to do it: Stand with your feet about hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip (palms facing your thighs). Position the dumbbells in front of your thighs, allowing your arms to hang straight down. Engage your core muscles to stabilize your spine. Keep your chest up, shoulders back, and your back straight throughout the movement. Keeping a slight bend in your knees, initiate the movement by hinging at your hips. Push your hips back as if you're trying to touch your glutes to the wall behind you. Lower the dumbbells towards the floor while maintaining a straight back. Keep the dumbbells close to your body throughout the movement. Lower the dumbbells until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. Your back should remain flat, and your torso should remain parallel to the floor throughout the movement. Be cautious not to round your back. If you feel your back starting to round, stop the descent and come back up. Once you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, reverse the movement by driving your hips forward and squeezing your glutes. Focus on using your hamstrings and glutes to pull yourself back up to the starting position. Keep the dumbbells close to your body as you rise. Perform the desired number of repetitions while maintaining proper form and control over the weight.",https://www.jefit.com/exercises/1433/dumbbell-romanian-deadlift
